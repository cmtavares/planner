## Project

In this project I developed a comprehensive application for creating and managing travel itineraries. This tool was developed to help users organize their trips by allowing them to record and track all the activities they plan to undertake during their trips!

## Configuration

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/cmtavares/trip-planner.git
   ```

2. Build the application:

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the application:

    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

Visit http://localhost:5173 to view the application.
